## about
MITE:Reborn is a survival mod for Minecraft that has one goal, and one goal only: to make Minecraft as difficult as possible.
This is a re-imagined version of the MITE mod, which was released as a mod for Minecraft 1.6.4.  I highly suggest you try out that mod
before trying MITE:Reborn, as many of the features in this mod will be based off of ones that can be found in the original MITE mod.
